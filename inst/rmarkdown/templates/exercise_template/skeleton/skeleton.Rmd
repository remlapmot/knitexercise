<!-- When knitting your own document please delete or 
comment out the following example code. -->

- When knitting the questions, set `solutions: FALSE` in the YAML header.
- When knitting the solutions, set `solutions: TRUE` in the YAML header.
- If using the Knit button in RStudio with `solutions: TRUE` the output filename will have `-solutions` appended before the file extension.

1. This is an example question. It contains some R code which is always included in the output document with the chunk option `include=TRUE`.
    ```{r, include=TRUE}
    1 + 1
    ```

    ```{asis}
    Paragraph text for solutions is put in `asis` code chunks.
    
    R code chunks for solutions are put in standard `r` code chunks.
    ```

    ```{r}
    1 + 1
    ```
  
2. This is question 2.
