# Introduction

- This example R Markdown document demonstrates how to include questions and answers in the same Rmd document.

- When rendering the questions, in the YAML header set `solutions: FALSE`
- When rendering the solutions, in the YAML header set `solutions: TRUE`
- If rendering using the knit button the output filename will end `-solutions.extension` due to the custom knit function which I modified from Yihui Xie's advice [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/custom-knit.html).

# Questions

- To generate pdf output you need the TinyTeX package installed, `install.packages('tinytex')`.

- Paragraph text for questions is written in standard R Markdown syntax, which can include LaTeX maths and code chunks.

- In questions, R code chunks for which you want to see the code or output or both require the chunk option `include=TRUE`, i.e.
  ````
  ```{r, include=TRUE}`r ''`
  ...code...
  ```
  ````

# Solutions

- Paragraph text for solutions go in `asis` code chunks, i.e.
  ````
  ```{asis}`r ''`
  ...Text explaining the answer ...
  ```
  ````

  ```{asis}
  Paragraph text for answers.
  ```

- R code chunks for solutions are included as normal, i.e.
  ````
  ```{r}`r ''`
  ...Code for answer...
  ```
  ````

- You can use your preferred R Markdown syntax for laying out your questions. I often use simple section headers, e.g.
  ```
  # Question 1
  ```

- For numbered sections add the option `number_sections: true` to the output in the YAML header.

## Example R code chunk

The following code chunk will only be included when you have set `solutions: TRUE`.
```{r}
curve(x^2)
```
